You will want to be running a simple python server to use this

depending on your version it will meen running 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

or 

python -m http.server 3000

Also figured it would be easier is we just used html + css to do all the work (and not the canvas), not sure what you guys think but feel like it's the right choice as we can manipulate the elements easier.

cool.
